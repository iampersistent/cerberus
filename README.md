# Cerberus

Cerberus is an [ABAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-Based_Access_Control) permissions system based on the [XACML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XACML) standard, borrowing heavily from the now retired [OpenAZ project](http://incubator.apache.org/projects/openaz.html).

There is still a lot of work to do and many more features to be implemented. Please add an issue or a pull request when needed.

You can find documentation in the [/docs](https://github.com/finicprint/cerberus/blob/master/docs) folder

In Greek mythology, Cerberus, often called the "hound of Hades", is a monstrous multi-headed dog, 
who guards the gates of the underworld. Cerberus the library guards actions and data in your system.
